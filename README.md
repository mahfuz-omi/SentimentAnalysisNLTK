# SentimentAnalysisNLTK
This is my very first sentiment analysis program which works on NLTK 

This program inputs a movie review, and outputs corresponding feedback(neg for negative review and pos for positive review). I have used
nltk "movie_reviews" dataset for training my model. Initially I used top-N-words model which showed a very bad performance. Then I used 
Bag-of-Words (BoW) model which counts all words. I used NaiveBayesClassifier from nltk package.
